We have removed extraneous text where possible by cutting out details that were not important for the overall discussion.  We removed one figure, but determined that others could not be removed.

We recognize that this paper is longer than a typical Letter still, and likely goes into greater depth on the "What is it?" question than one might expect at first glance.  However, we feel that the length and depth of the discussion in that section (which comprises most of the text) is proportionate to the observational similarity and is therefore needed to convince the reader that the MUBLO is not compellingly identified as belonging to one of these classes.

We have reframed the discussion of the spatial measurements by noting that we
expect the errors to be dominated by systematic uncertainty. We have removed the
speculative proper motion measurement, since we regard it as unlikely to be
real.

We added 'and their isotopologues' to clarify that, indeed, the 34S
isotopologues are detected.
We have also restructured the figure to show detections on the left and nondetections of relevant molecules on the right.

Our point here was to emphasize that H13CO+ is _not_ detected, even though there
is apparent signal in the figure.  The spectrum contains some irreducible
background structure that shows up as mostly positive residuals that makes it
appear as though there is a detection, but as emphasized in the text, it is not
compact and therefore should not be attributed to the MUBLO.

Indeed, this was poorly phrased.  We have changed it to:
"Similarly, the small value of the spatial gradient with velocity suggests that
it is face-on."
In order to derive a timescale from this gradient, we would need to know the associated
spatial scale, which is only poorly constrained.  If we formally reduce the velocity
gradient to a timescale, it's ~90 years.

This is a good point, so we have added the parenthetical:
"(but in old LRN, like CK Vul, SiO has not frozen out)"
to acknowledge that.

We have restructured Table 2 to be clearer about the origin of the data.  34SO 2(3)-2(1) is detected in ACES; it's on the edge of the window.

Indeed, we were using J(N) instead of N(J).  Splatalogue reports the former, while JPL and CDMS report the latter.  We have switched to the N(J) convention, which seems more widely adopted and appropriate given the explanation on CDMS.

We removed the frequency width.

We added these.

CH3C3N was included by mistake, it's not detected and not an interesting nondetection.
We added QNs for 33SO.

That was the SO 3(2)-2(1) line. (but we removed that spectrum)

Those are from extended CO emission.  We added a clarification that the CO is diffuse.

Yes, that's a very likely identification.  Since it is composed of narrow
absorption features, we did not identify this line as being associated with the
MUBLO.

We failed to describe these data in the first draft.  We added a sentence in the
observation section referring to the MUSTANG data, which are used to fill in the
short spacing in this image.  We do not use these data for any measurements,
just for display.

Added description.

Since we are not using these images for quantitative analysis, and we did not
try to investigate in detail the flux calibration of the images (we instead
trust the published catalogs), we prefer not to show colorbars on these images.

Spatial was intended, and indeed it was meant to convey the point you have added.
We have made the point more explicit.

The point is to highlight that only ~3 magnitudes are likely from the diffuse
line of sight; the remaining extinction would need to be produced locally.
We've rephrased to make this clearer.

Force of habit!  We have corrected this figure to match the 8 kpc used

The scale of the vectors is arbitary; we were only looking for trends, not absolute values.
In the interest of saving space (and not cluttering figure 11), we simply remove this figure.

We have clarified by adding "FWHM" to the subscript.  This is the deconvolved
object size reported in Table 3.  It could be interpreted as a diameter, but is
more accurately treated as the FWHM of a Gaussian emission profile.

TODO: @miriam

This is likely because the N(SO) and N(CS) from models use all the lines (from the modeled abundances), while in this work we estimated N(SO) using 3 emission lines and the LTE approach (Figure 7). Furthermore, to determine N(CS) we assume the same rotational temperature than that estimated for SO in the rotational diagram. Possibly, the estimated SO/CS column density is a lower limit. We need more CS and SO lines to better determine this ratio.
