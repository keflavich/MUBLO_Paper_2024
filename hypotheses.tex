    \caption{Hypotheses that have been evaluated and the evidence for (green +) and against (red -) them; blank means the evidence is neither for nor against.
    The overall weight given to the hypothesis is given by its color code - yellow are not entirely ruled out, orange are strongly disfavored but still possible, and red are very low likelihood.
    There is at least one strong item of evidence against each hypothesis considered.
